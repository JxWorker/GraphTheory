# GraphTheory
## General Information
In the folder "TaskAndNotes" can you find some of my notes and the task as a PDF.

### Instruction for the UI
When you start the application, you first have to choose with the combobox in the top left corner which option you want. Firstly, do you want to create a graph yourself.  Secondly, use the graph from the task. Thirdly, use the graph I used to test the code.

When you select to create a graph yourself, you get another combobox to decide how many routes your graph has. The minimum is 3 and the maximum is 10. After that, you get the selected number text boxes to type in your routes in this form: [start]-[end]-[cost]. [start] and [end] are both a single character. Right beneath those text boxes are 3 buttons. The first button saves your graph until the application is closed, or another graph is created. The second button gives you the possibility to calculate the distance of a route, the number of routes between two points and the shortest route between two points. The third button shows the questions from the task and their results with the created graph.
If you select to use my test graph or the graph from the task, you get two buttons. The first button gives you the possibilities as the second button when you create a graph. The second button shows the questions from the task and their results with the selected graph.

If you have decided to calculate something else, then the task wanted you get 3 new columns. The first column lets you calculate the distance of a route, which you have to specify in this form: [point 1]- [point 2]- [point 3]- â€¦ [point n]. The second column lets you calculate the number of routes between two points. It is also possible to set 1 of 7 conditions.
1. Just count the number of routes between two points.
2. Count the number of routes between two points with exactly n stops.
3. Count the number of routes between two points with equal or fewer stops.
4. Count the number of routes between two points with equal or more stops.
5. Count the number of routes between two points with an exact distance.
6. Count the number of routes between two points with a lower distance.
7. Count the number of routes between two points with a higher distance.

Last but not least, the third column calculates the shortest route between two points.
